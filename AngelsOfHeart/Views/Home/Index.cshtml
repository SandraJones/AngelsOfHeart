        <h2>Projects our volunteers have enjoyed.</h2>
        <p>
            Our wonderful volunteers love to serve others. Whether it is collecting
            goods for needy elderly, or taking food to The Branch food ministry, our
            volunteers enjoy finding a need and filling it with their own hands. For one
            project, we collected socks and other items for Christmas gifts to
            the needy elderly who are at Trevecca Towers. Another project our volunteers
            enjoyed was gathering clothing and other items for families in need in El Salvadore.

        <h2>Help yourself as you help others.</h2>

            Much has been written about the psychological benefits of volunteering.
            Feeling down? Reach out and help someone who has a greater need than you
            do. Many people in the U.S. are richly blessed with a home and regular
            supply of water and power, as well as a job that pays for food and clothing,
            but that is not the case in many parts of the world, and even in some
            areas of the U.S. When we take our focus off of ourselves and focus on the
            serious need of others, we appreciate what we have even more.

            Do you have a talent for craft or kindness? If so, there is a way for you
            to help someone. We'll be happy to have your talents added to our efforts.
            However, if you are too busy to help, perhaps you want to donate?
