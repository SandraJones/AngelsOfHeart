        <h2>Projects our volunteers have enjoyed.</h2>
        <p>
            Our wonderful volunteers love to serve others. Whether it is collecting
            goods for needy elderly, or taking food to The Branch food ministry, our
            volunteers enjoy finding a need and filling it with their own hands.

            Much has been written about the psychological benefits of volunteering.
            Feeling down? Reach out and help someone who has a greater need than you
            do.
